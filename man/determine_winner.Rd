\title{Determine the outcome of a Monty Hall Problem game.}
\usage{
determine_winner(final.pick, game)
}
\arguments{
\item{final_pick}{An integer (1, 2, or 3) representing the contestant's
final door choice.}

\item{game_setup}{A character vector of length 3 representing the
distribution of prizes behind the doors (e.g., c("goat", "car", "goat")).}
}
\value{
The function returns a character string, either "car" if the contestant
won the car, or "goat" if they did not.
}
\description{
\code{determine_winner()} evaluates whether the contestant has won the car or
a goat based on their final door choice and the actual game setup.
}
\details{
In the Monty Hall Problem, the game concludes when the contestant makes
their final door selection. This function compares the contestant's final
choice with the actual distribution of prizes behind the doors to determine
if the contestant has won the car or a goat. It's a crucial part of the
simulation as it allows for the analysis of different strategies (switching
or staying) over multiple game iterations.

\examples{
  determine_winner(final_pick = 2, game_setup = c("goat", "car", "goat"))
  determine_winner(final_pick = 1, game_setup = c("goat", "goat", "car"))
