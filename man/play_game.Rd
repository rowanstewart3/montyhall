\title{Simulate one complete Monty Hall Problem game.}
\usage{
play_game()
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{no arguments are used by the function}
}
\value{
The function returns a data frame with two rows and two columns:
\itemize{
\item 'strategy': a character vector with values "stay" and "switch"
\item 'outcome': a character vector with the result ("car" or "goat") for each strategy
}
}
\description{
\code{play_game()} simulates a full round of the Monty Hall Problem, including
both "stay" and "switch" strategies, and returns the outcomes.
}
\details{
This function orchestrates a complete simulation of the Monty Hall Problem
by calling other functions to create the game setup, select the contestant's
initial door, open a goat door, and determine the outcomes for both "stay"
and "switch" strategies. It encapsulates the entire game process, from
initial setup to final results, allowing for easy simulation of multiple
games to analyze the probabilities associated with each strategy.

The function creates a new game setup, selects an initial door for the
contestant, opens a door revealing a goat, determines the final pick for both
"stay" and "switch" strategies, evaluates the outcome for both strategies,
returns the results in a data frame.
